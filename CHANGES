This file contains a summary of changes between releases. Please refer to
individual issues on http://tools.lsc-project.org/ for details.

Please note that this file contains changes for both the lsc-sample and lsc-core
components.


=== LSC release 1.2.0 (16/05/2010) ===

If you're upgrading from 1.1.*, see upgrading notes at:
http://lsc-project.org/wiki/documentation/1.2/upgrade-from-1.1

Major changes:
- Generation is no longer necessary (Objects no longer exist, and the new SimpleBean can be used in place of most specific beans)
- LSC-sample no longer exists (a demonstration configuration is in sample/ from the new distribution)
- Ant and Maven are no longer required. The only dependency for LSC is JRE (other dependencies are bundled)
- db2ldap configuration has been simplified: The configuration file database.properties is obsolete. Database connection properties are now read from the main lsc.properties file.
